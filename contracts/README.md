# Contracts

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

### Get a flattened version

```
 ./node_modules/truffle-flattener/index.js ./contracts/CoderDAO.sol > ./CoderDAOFlattened.sol
 ```
